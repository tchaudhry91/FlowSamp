Adaptation

+ Feedback Contents -> Utilisation Percentage (Based on total capacity)
+ Given -> Acceptable limit (Hard Limit)

Proposed Method
+ Find bottleneck
    Highest utilised parameter based on limit. (Care..45% utilisation out of 50% limit, more severe than 80% of 100% limit)
    * Because adaptation is simple increase or decrease, only most utilised parameter matters.    
    severity -> utilisation/limit

+ Decide on a soft limit
    This is a limit below the actual hard limit where the adaptation turns negetive
    For eg.
        softlimit = 0.9 * actual_limit
                    0.9->Variable

+ On basis of most severe factor decide adaptation rate as follows
    - adaptation factor = 1 + (soft_limit - utilisation) / soft limit) 
        - can be made more drastic by adding a multiplier

+ Can add Hard Multiplier
    - should limit exceed the hard limit the reduction should be more drastic
    - e.g if original adaptation factor was 0.8, in case of hard exceed, it would be 0.6 (considering hard mul of 2), or 0.4 (considering hard mul of 3)

+ Return this adaptation factor and multiply it with the current accept limit
    (Take care not to exceed 100, overflow)
